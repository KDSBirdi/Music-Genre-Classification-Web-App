# 🎶Music Genre Classification Website🎶
## Ever wondered how the music you listen gets classified as 'Romantic', 'Jazz', 'Pop', etc.? Well it is mostly done manually. How about a website that allows you to classify a music on your computer? Sounds interesting right..🌟
### Let me give you a brief overview how it's done. So, a music or any audio file is a combination of various tempos, zero-crossings, chromagrams, MFCCS, etc. When we take out a feature suppose MFCCS of a complete audio file it is basically a 2D-array of shape (20,x) where 20 represents parameters of MFCCS feature such as MFCCS1, MFCCS2, MFCCS3, etc. X represents the size values of these parameters. The larger the audio file, the larger is it's value.

### Before going further and explain you everything, how about taking a look at website?? 😍
